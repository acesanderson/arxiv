## Purpose of project

This is various ways of interacting with Arxiv papers.
This uses the dataset of all papers, from Kaggle.

### Ideas
- use my various summarize scripts
- take all my scripts and go through arxiv papers and have the model identify if there are optimizations from a given paper
- grab all prompt snippets from all papers
- similarity search by paper
- knowledge graph of arxiv papers
